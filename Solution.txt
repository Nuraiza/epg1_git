Pro Homework
1 First I created a fork of https://github.com/squadack/epg1_git just by clicking to the upper right button 'fork'
2 Then cloned it to my desktop by command 
git clone https://github.com/Nuraiza/epg1_git.git
3 Created my branch by command 
git checkout -b hw-s19241
4 Rebased rebase-me branch on top of my branch
git checkout rebase-me
git rebase hw-s19241
5 Fast-forwarded my branch to the tip of rebase-me
git checkout hw-s19241
git merge rebase-me
6 Merged branch merge-me into my branch
git checkout hw-s19241
git merge origin/merge-me
Then there appeared conflict in Readme.md during merging
git status
I simply resolved conflict in text editor then committed changes
git commit -m "resolved conflict"
